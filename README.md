Bank Customer Management System
🧾 Project Overview
A simple C-based command-line banking system that manages customer records using a static array of structures. The program allows adding, editing, deleting, and viewing customers, along with essential banking operations such as money transfer, deposit, and withdrawal. All data is stored persistently in a text file (customers.txt).
